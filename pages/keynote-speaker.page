Deo started our conference on the literal and figurative right foot with his engaging presentation, "Ignite Your Creativity and Trust the Process." Through movement and words, Deo shared his experiences with teaching dance in various communities and publicly telling his story as a refugee. Deo demonstrated the transformative power of dance as a communicative art form, and highlighted the importance of openness and trust throughout the creative process."</p>
